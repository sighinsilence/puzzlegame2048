            <div class="space-y-4">
                <p>2048 is an addictive sliding puzzle game that challenges your brain. The goal is simple yet tricky: combine matching number tiles to create a tile with the number 2048.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Use your arrow keys (or swipe on mobile) to move all tiles in one direction</li>
                    <li>When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with double the value</li>
                    <li>After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears randomly on the board</li>
                    <li>Continue combining tiles to reach the coveted 2048 tile</li>
                    <li>The game ends when you can no longer make moves</li>
                </ol>
                <p>While reaching 2048 is the main goal, you can continue playing to achieve even higher numbers and improve your high score!</p>
